# Movie App

Phone Movie App made with React Native. It includes stack navigation, apis handled with axios, custom hooks, icons and carousels. 

## Getting started

After installing the dependencies run

```
npx react-native run-ios
# or
npx react-native run-android
```

This will automatically build the app and deploy it in your simulation.

## Libraries

### React Navigation

Library used for handling the navigation of the app. All info [here](https://reactnavigation.org/)

### React Native Snap Carousel

Library used for including the carousel in the app, both ios and android. All info [here](https://github.com/meliorence/react-native-snap-carousel)

### React Native Vector Icons

I've used this library to include icons in the app. Check the different posibilities [here](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)

### React Native Image Colors

Super interesting library to fetch the prominent colors of an image. Used here to change the background depending on the Pokemon. Take a look [here](https://npmmirror.com/package/react-native-image-colors)

### React Native Linear Gradient

The library is used to generate a gradient from the main colors of the movie. [Here](https://github.com/react-native-linear-gradient/react-native-linear-gradient) for more.
